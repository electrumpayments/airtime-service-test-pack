# Airtime Service Interface

The Airtime Service Interface test pack provides a means to test both client and server implementaions of the Electrum Airtime Service Interface.

You can find documentation for this project [here](https://electrumpayments.github.io/airtime-service-interface-docs/).

## Client Testing With The Test Server

Client implementations may be tested by configuring clients to point towards the [test server](http://airtime-service-test-pack.herokuapp.com).

## Server Testing With Postman and Newman

Server implementations may be tested using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) and [Newman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/newman_intro). Scripts are available to automate the sending of requests to the server to be tested and to validate the responses from the server.
